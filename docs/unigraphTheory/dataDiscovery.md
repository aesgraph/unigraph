## _**Unigraph as a Data Discovery and Marketplace Ecosystem**_

### Unigraph can also serve as the foundation for **a decentralized data discovery and marketplace ecosystem**. By connecting **structured knowledge, metadata, and behavioral models**, Unigraph enables:

- **Seamless discovery of structured data across diverse domains**
- **Composable and interoperable data models that can evolve dynamically and safely with semantic versioning**
- **Trustless and verifiable data exchange with provenance tracking**
- **A marketplace for knowledge, where AI and human agents can trade, refine, and analyze information**
