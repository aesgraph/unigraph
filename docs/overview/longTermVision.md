## Unigraph: the long-term vision

The transition from Unigraph to [Aesgraph](../aesgraph/index.md) will happen gradually. 

Unigraph aims to combine the best of Obsidian, VSCode, and Copilot into a single product for graph-based ideation, modeling, visualization, and analytics. 

Unigraph sees itself as becoming an indespensible tool for data scientists, educators, and students, and many others. Unigraph aims to become an "IDE for analytics" by unifying graph-based technologies through a standard language and framework.

Unigraph offers a new paradigm for how humans represent and interpret information, to an unprecedented degree of accessibility.
