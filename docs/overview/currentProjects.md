## 1. Unigraph Graphviz Integration

Unigraph will provide seamless, first-class support for loading and interactively editing Graphviz diagrams with a clean, intuitive workflow. While partial integration exists, the goal is to maximize feature compatibility while ensuring an accessible, GUI-driven editing experience. Existing tools lack flexible post-editing for predefined diagrams, making this a crucial capability. As one of the most advanced graph specification languages, full Graphviz support will significantly enhance Unigraph’s versatility and usability.

## 2. Add an AI Copilot to Unigraph

As a user I want the ability to prompt a copilot to create and modify graphs on my behalf. This work entails adding a Copilot applet to Unigraph, and connecting it to the Unigraph state management system.
This work has not been started.

## 3. Unigraph YASGUI Integration

Provide a first-class experience for SPARQL querying and seamless entity importing into Unigraph from the Semantic Web. This integration will enable users to interact with SPARQL endpoints, retrieve structured data, and incorporate it into Unigraph’s knowledge graph, enhancing interoperability with Wikidata, DBpedia, and other linked data sources. By bridging graph-based personal knowledge management with external structured knowledge, this project will significantly expand Unigraph’s capabilities as a human-centric information engine.
