**SceneGraph**

In the domain of computer science, scene graph is a general data structure commonly used in vector-based graphics applications and computer games, which arranges the logical and often spatial representation in a graphical scene.<br>
In Unigraph, scene graphs are essentially save files. Unigraph is built to simplify inspections and interactions of complex graph structures by supporting composable graphs, filters, layouts, and display configurations and presets.

_A SceneGraph file contains the following_

- Model Graph
- Display Presets
- Filter Presets
- Layout Presets
- Unigraph Settings
- Scenes (Filter+Layout+Display Combinations)

**Applet**

An applet is an instance of Unigraph that is configured to perform a specific task. Unigraph is a general purpose tool, but it is designed for extension and configuration, and it can be converted to an applet that targets a specific use case. For example, there will be a Unigraph applet for exploring the semantic web databases
