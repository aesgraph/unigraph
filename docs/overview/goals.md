## The near-term vision

Unigraph aims to be an adaptor between web-based client-side interactive graph-based applications.

Some popular existing graph based libraries and tools Unigraph aims to leverage are listed [here](./motivation.md/#graph-based-web-libraries). Unigraph is not replacing, but absorbing and extending existing solutions so that they are interoperable.
Unigraph is a single technology to build higher level applications that are interoperable.

Some examples of higher level applications are in the domains of:

* System Design and Diagramming
* Semantic Technologies: Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies
* Data and Tool Discovery, Composition, and Chaining
* Research and Collaboration

Unigraph is a general solution for web-based client-side interaction with Graphs.
Unigraph aims to provide a field-theoretical framework for interoperable graph-based applications.

### What the demo should support (in progress)
- Graph-Definition Languages
    - Dot
    - MermaidJS
    - GraphML
    - JSON (Unigraph format)
- Interaction Layer Libraries
    - ReactFlow
    - WebGL + ForceGraph

### Unigraph Demo Application Features (in progress)
- Import -> Edit -> Export Workflows
- Graph Model Editing
- Display Model Editing 
    - Rendering Configuration, e.g. Positions, Colors, Sizing
    - Layouts
    - Filtering
    - Presets
- Support for Multimedia and Annotations
- Sub-applications ðŸš§
    - ImageBox Annotation Tool

### Integrations for the Unigraph Demo
- Semantic Web Navigator (dbpedia + yasgui)
- Graph Editing IDE (monaco + vercel ai)
- SignIn and online File Management (supabase)

## The long-term vision
1. An IDE for graph-based visualization and analytics
2. Full Semantic Web Integration
3. Git-level version control for graph management
4. Data Access Controls for distributed collaboration

Unigraph aims to combine the best of Obsidian, VSCode, and Copilot into a single product for graph-based ideation, modeling, visualization, and analytics. 

Unigraph sees itself as becoming an indespensible tool for data scientists, educators, and students, and many others. Unigraph aims to become an "IDE for analytics" by unifying graph-based technologies through a standard language and framework.

Unigraph offers a new paradigm for how humans represent and interpret information, with an unprecedented degree of accessibility.

Unigraph aims to become the central means through which humans interact with software.
