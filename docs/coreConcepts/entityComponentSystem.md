## Entity Component System

Unigraph uses an Entity Component System under the hood to centralize development and behavior of data management and UI components. This streamlines development and lowers the barrier of complexity to creating powerful, higher-level components than what are found in traditional UI component libraries.

An Entity has common attributes commonly found in data objects including UUID, Label, Type, and Tags. 
UI components in Unigraph that display and interact with Entities are built for these types.

Some higher-level components in Unigraph that operate at the Entity Level:<br>
Entity Search View<br>
Entity Selection View<br>
Entity Filter View<br>
Entity Display View<br>
