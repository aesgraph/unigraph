## Model and Display Separation

Unigraph is a graph engine designed to decouple graph structure from graph presentation, allowing for the creation of complex, multi-perspective visualizations. It enables users to compose intricate system diagrams and present them in ways that are configurable, human-interpretable, and adaptable to different contexts.

The graph model is distinct from display scenes, allowing multiple representations of the same data.

Users can define custom configurations to emphasize different aspects of a graph, making it adaptable to various use cases and audiences.
