Unigraph is both a deep technology, and an attempt to materialize it. It aims to productize itself as a means to build interest and community, but its final intention is far beyond. It aims to build a field-theoretic framework for application ecosystems centered on human-centric graph-based modeling, interaction, and information exchange.

Unigraph's first aim is to create an accessible platform for graph-based application software and information exchange. 
**The MVP centralizes accessibility to various existing diagramming tools in a single state-of-the-art web application.**
